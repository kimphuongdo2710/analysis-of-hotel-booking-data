# Analysis of Hotel Booking Data (updating...)
## 1. Business Context

You have been hired by a luxury hotel chain to analyze business performance based on booking data from the past 2 years.

The hotel management is facing several business challenges and needs you to find key insights to optimize revenue, reduce cancellations, and improve customer experience.

ðŸ›  Your tasks:

- Answer business questions using data
- Propose strategies to maximize hotel revenue
- Visualize data with BI tools or Python
- Present your findings as a dashboard or presentation

## 2. Materials and Methods
- Tool: **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio**
- Data Source: Provided by Dá»©a Data.
- Use SQLAlchemy to connect with MySQL database.
- Time range: for bookings created from 12-02-2023 to 10-02-2025
- Data Limitations:
   1. In table rooms_senior, status "Available" and "Booked" are vague which not clear state which period of this status.

| No. | Table Name | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 1.     | Customers     | Contain information about customers who have previously booked rooms at the hotel     |
| 2.    | Rooms     | Store information about the rooms in the hotel     |
| 3.   | Bookings     | Record the booking history of customers     |
| 4.   | Payments     | Record customers' payments     |
| 5.   | Services     | Contain a list of additional services in the hotel     |
| 6.   | Service_Usage     | Record the services that customers have used in the hotel     |

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 3.1 Data Validation and Transformation
- Create and double check Primary Keys and Foreign Keys from tables:

```
with connection.connect() as conn:
    inspector = inspect(conn)
    tables = inspector.get_table_names()
    
    for table in tables:
        print("\n"f"Table: {table}")
        fks = inspector.get_foreign_keys(table)
        pk = inspector.get_pk_constraint(table)
        print("Primary key(s):", pk['constrained_columns'])
        if fks:
            for fk in fks:
                print(f"  Foreign Key: {fk['constrained_columns']} -> {fk['referred_table']}({fk['referred_columns']})")
        else:
                print("  No foreign keys")
```

- Check the relationships among tables and right below is an output:

```
relations = []

with connection.connect() as conn:
    inspector = inspect(conn)
    tables = inspector.get_table_names()
    
    for table in tables:
        fks = inspector.get_foreign_keys(table)
        for fk in fks:
            relations.append({
                "table": table,
                "column": fk['constrained_columns'],
                "references_table": fk['referred_table'],
                "references_column": fk['referred_columns']
            })

df_rel = pd.DataFrame(relations)
print(df_rel)
```

### 3.2 Anomaly Detection
| Flag For Review                  | Action Plan                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| **1,468 bookings** have a ```created_at``` date that is after the ```payment_date```, of which **1,222 are unique bookings**, indicating that some guests made a payment before the booking was officially created.<br><br>â†’ ***Discussion:*** This situation can occur if a returning guest has an unpaid balance from a previous stay, or due to system cut-off errors, or from data entry, timezone, or software issues. |Double check with the operation staffs, but keep data as it is for now        |
| ***Refund Fraud***: In **507 cases**, payments were made after the bookings had already been canceled.<br><br>â†’ ***Discussion:*** This could mean one of the following:<br>- The payment was for additional services (such as spa or gym) that may use the same booking_id.<br>To confirm this, we need to check if the hotel uses the same booking_id for these extra services.<br>- If the booking_id is not reused for other services, the payment might represent compensation for the canceled booking.<br>- Otherwise, these cases may indicate an error in the hotel management system. |Double check with the operation staffs, but keep data as it is for now        |
| ***Cancelation Fraud***: There are **1,702 cases** where guests checked into their rooms even though their bookings were marked as cancelled. |Remove these cases out of the dataset      |
| ***Double Bookings*** (same check_in date, same check_out date and same rooms): There are **6 cases** where the same room has been booked for overlapping periods. |I have decided to keep these as they are because the statuses are not the same. The reservation team may have intentionally created double bookings before guest confirmation in order to maximize revenue. However, one concern is why the status has not been updated even though the stay period is already over.      |
   
### 3.2 Data Exploration
- Using CTEs to measure the Occupancy Rate for each Room Type:

```
WITH daily_booked_by_room_type AS (
    SELECT rm.room_type, ebd.curr_check_in,
            COUNT(ebd.curr_check_in) AS booked_room_count
	FROM expand_booking_by_date ebd
    JOIN rooms_senior rm ON ebd.room_id = rm.room_id
    GROUP BY rm.room_type, ebd.curr_check_in),
    
    total_available_rooms_by_room_type AS (
    SELECT room_type,
			COUNT(*) AS available_room_count_by_room_type
	FROM rooms_senior
    GROUP BY room_type
    )
    
SELECT dbb.curr_check_in, dbb.room_type,
		ROUND((dbb.booked_room_count*100 / avai.available_room_count_by_room_type),2) AS occupancy_rate
FROM daily_booked_by_room_type dbb
JOIN total_available_rooms_by_room_type avai
	ON dbb.room_type = avai.room_type
GROUP BY dbb.curr_check_in, dbb.room_type
```
## 4. Key Business Insights
###  4.1 Hotel Booking Performance
**Occupancy Rate for each Room Type**

**Findings:**
- While Deluxe and Standard rooms are more popular during the summer, Executive, Suite, and President rooms are preferred in the winter and spring. 

**Recommentions**
- Investigate the impact of temperature and room landscape views on increasing bookings for each room type.
- Develop a marketing strategy for each room type based on their seasonal popularity.
